## Code ðŸ’»

I write code for a living and, where possible, I open-source it. Below is a list of a few of the things I've written. I also maintain a list of useful [code snippets](/snippets).

- [#Clicky](https://github.com/joshfarrant/slack-clicky) is a Chrome Extension designed to make sharing links to Slack as easy as possible.
- [This very website](https://github.com/joshfarrant/josh-farrant-me) is static site which is generated using a custom-built static site generator, which will be open-sourced very soon!
- [Drag Race](https://github.com/joshfarrant/drag-race) is a super simple JavaScript code execution speed tester.
- I built a [Node.js client](https://github.com/Nimvelo/node-client) for the [Nimvelo](https://www.nimvelo.com) API. This was written a few years ago and I'd like to spend some time modernising it when I get the chance.
