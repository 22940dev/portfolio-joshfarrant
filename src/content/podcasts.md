## Podcasts ðŸŽ™

Life is better with podcasts. I squeeze podcast listening into any part of the day that I can. I might listen when cooking, cleaning, cycling, but not coding; my brain can't handle that.

My podcast player of choice is [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), written by Marco Arment. It's by far the best podcast player I've ever used and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's very likely that it's my most-used app in the 10+ years I've owned an iPhone.

### ðŸŽ§ Must-listens

These are the shows I'm fully caught up on and listen to as soon as they come out.


- **The Adventure Zone**

  My favourite podcast of them all. The Adventure Zone started life as a DnD podcast, but became so much more than that thanks to the masterful storytelling of the DM, Griffin McElroy. This is a podcast that anyone will enjoy, but if you're still unsure then I'd recommend just listening to the first 10 episodes; I'd be suprised if you're not hooked by then.

- **The Besties (RIP)**

  Oh Besties, what a rollercoaster ride your past has been. From weekly, to cancelled, to monthly, to hiatus, to yearly, things have never been simple. Four games journalists, all originally at Polygon, debate the best games of the ~~week~~ ~~month~~ year.

- **The Complete Guide To Everything**

  A classic _Two Dudes Talking_ comedy podcast. A couple of New Yorkers explain everything from Appetizers to Zooey Deschanel in an informal, and usually ill-prepared, way.

- **Cortex**

  CGP Grey and Myke Hurley discuss all things productivity, as well as life in general. It's way better than I'm making it sound here, trust me.

  - **Do By Friday**

  A podcast from Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity), Alex Cox, and Merlin Mann. The premise is that, each week, the three hosts have to complete a challenge before the next episode. The scope of the challenges varies quite a lot, and can be as simple as trying Kombucha or watching a terrible movie, to buying and consuming some of Alex Jones' powders or getting an NFC implant. Most shows, however, inevitably descend into discussions about whatever ~~ignorant~~ ~~idiotic~~ _just plain awful_ thing Trump did in the preceeding week.

- **Hello Internet**

  The only podcast I know of with it's own flag^[[Flaggy Flag](http://flaggyflag.com/), the one true flag.] and Medal of Honor. CGP Grey and Brady Haran discuss YouTube, the internet, and anything else that may be relevant. From plane crashes to penguins, postcards to paper cuts, they have a corner for just about everything.

- **The McElroy Brothers Will Be In Trolls  2**

  This podcasts takes you behind the scenes and throws you into the story of how the McElroy brothers were able to get roles in the hit film Trolls 2. Unless, that is, they don't.

- **My Brother, My Brother and Me**

  Another of my very favourite podcasts. Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy host an advice show for the _modren_ era, where they answer listener questions, as well as questions from the internet's bastion of knowledge, Yahoo Answers.

- **My Dad Wrote A Porno**

  Imagine finding out that your father has started writing ~~porn~~ erotic literature, then imagine reading and discussing those books on a podcast.

- **Playing for Fun**

  A podcast about the love of video games. No discussions about the industry or toxic communities, just two people talking about the games they love.

- **Pop Everything**

  Tim and Tom of _The Complete Guide To Everything_ discuss and explain pop culture.

- **Reply All**

  Reply All is a difficult podcast to explain, but it's one of most interesting and highest quality podcasts that I listen to. This is one that I think absolutely anyone will enjoy.

- **Serial**

  Probably the most well-known podcast on this list. Serial follows a reporter's journey as she looks into crimes, the people who committed them, and the people around them. I'd recommend starting with Season 1, maybe skipping Season 2, then jumping back in with Season 3.

- **Subnet**

  A daily micro-podcast, usually only a couple of minutes long, which gives you the day's tech news in _byte_-sized updates. This is always pinned to the top of my main playlist in Overcast.

- **Syntax**

  Two educational JavaScript YouTubers, Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, discuss the JavaScript ecosystem, upcoming ECMAScript features, and interesting libraries. No matter how well I think I know a topic, I always find myself learning something new.

### ðŸ—ƒ Backlog

These are the shows that I've only discovered relatively recently, and so I'm still working though a backlog of old episodes. If I'm not listening to one of the _Must-Listens_ above, then I'm listening to these.


- **Bear Brook**

  A true crime podcast about a murder case in New Hampshire. This Serial-esque show has so far presented a well told and captivating story that's keeping me hooked.

- **Hello from the Magic Tavern**

  A _completely fictional_ podcast about a game designer who finds himself in a strange, magical land after falling through a dimensional portal behind a Burger King. I'm working my way through Season 1 at the moment and I'm really enjoying the show so far. It's kind of like a two dudes talking show, if one of the dudes was a wizard, and there was also a talking badger, and it was set in a magical, fantastical land.

### ðŸ”” Keeping on top of

These are shows I really enjoy listening to, but that I've decided not to go back through the entire history of. Instead, I just listen to new shows as they come out.


- **Remaster**

  A show about the gaming industry. It's worth a listen to keep on top of gaming news and releases.

- **Upgrade**

  Ostensibly a show about technology in general, but more often than not focuses specifically on the Apple ecosystem.


---

### ðŸ—„ The rest

These are shows that I'm a fan of, but I don't religiously listen to new episodes of. Equally, they may be shows that have now ended. If I've somehow burnt through all above shows, I might pick out some unlistened episodes from these shows.


- **A Very Fatal Murder**

  A parody of investigative journalism podcasts (read: Serial) by The Onion. I'd listen to Serial and possibly S-Town before listening to this.

- **Aunty Donna Podcast**

  Aunty Donna is an Australian comedy group whose sketches I (mostly) adore. I listened to their podcast religiously when it first started, however I've now found myself skipping most new episodes.

- **CoolGames Inc**:

  Two guys (previously) from Polygon create and explore ideas for new games. Not all ideas were good, but Nick and Griffin's bizarre takes on them always made this show a good listen. Sadly, this show is currently on an indefinite hiatus.

- **Developer Tea**

  Short discussions about topics relevant to developers, designed to fit inside your tea break.

- **Front End Happy Hour**

  Engineers from a variety of companies including Netflix, Evernote, and Atlassian get together every fortnight to discuss the world of Front End development.

- **The History of Fun**

  A show from Polygon that explores the hidden backstories behind the things you love to do.

- **The Indicator from Planet Money**

  A short daily show exploring the indicators that influence our economy.

- **Liftoff**

  A fortnightly podcast about all things space, following the latest developments in the space industry.

- **Medium Playback**

  Medium invite authors of popular articles to read their story on the show, and then discuss it afterwards.

- **The Pen Addict**

  A weekly fix for all things stationery. It's more interesting than it sounds, trust me!

- **Til Death Do Us Blart**

  The McElroy brothers and The Worst Idea of All Time watch and review the film _Paul Blart Mall Cop 2_ every Thanksgiving from 2015 until the end of linear time. As hosts inevitably die, they will be replaced and the show will continue.

- **The Unmade Podcast**

  Tim and Brady discuss ideas for podcasts that they will (probably) never make.

- **Wonderful!**

  Griffin and Rachel McElroy discuss everything and anything that makes them happy.
