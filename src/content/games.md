## Games üé≤

Games are one of my favourite pastimes. I've played games (video, board, and card) for as long as I can remember, and have owned a console from every generation from the NES onwards. In that time I've played far, far too many games to catalogue completely, so here's a list of games from the last 25+ years that have stood out to me. As time goes on and this site evolves, I'd like to write a few sentences about what makes each game stand out to me.

Games are listed under the system that I played them on, which isn't necessarily the system that they were released on. They may also be duplicated across systems, if they stood out on both.

- **Bears vs Babies**
- **Coup**
- **Crib**
