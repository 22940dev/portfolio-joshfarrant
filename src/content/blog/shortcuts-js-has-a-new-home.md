I’m happy to announce that Shortcuts JS finally has a proper home!

Say hello to [Shortcuts.fun](https://shortcuts.fun)!

The only real source of information on the library before now was the README on GitHub, so I’m really happy to have a better looking place to send people who want to learn more about the library.

I’ve also spent a bit of time building a Playground into the site, so you can now play around with Shortcuts JS right in your browser! Downloading a Shortcut from the Playground doesn’t currently work on iOS, but I’ll be adding support for that in the near future.

### Help Make Shortcuts JS Better

As you’ll see, we’re currently about 10% of the way through implementing all of Apple’s built-in actions into Shortcuts JS. If you’d like to help us get just a bit closer to 100% then I’d love to have you as a contributor! Adding an action only takes a few minutes, and I’m more than happy to help you get started. Plus, you’ll get pride-of-place in the Contributors section!
