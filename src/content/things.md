## Things I Use üõ†

There are a lot of _things_ out there; some are better than others. This is a list of some of the things I use.

### Writing ‚úçÔ∏è

- Pen: **Retro 51 Tornado, Orange**

  Recommended by Myke Hurley on The Pen Addict. It's the first refillable pen I've bought and I'm very happy with it.

- Notebook: **Leuchtturm1917 dotted, Orange**

  Perfect for [Bullet Journalling](https://bulletjournal.com). I don't use this as much as I used to, but it's handy to keep around for sketching out ideas that I don't want to lose or forget about.

- Notepad: **Muji Memo Pad, A6**

  Cheap, recycled, and perfect for scribbling down quick notes and ideas.

- Notepad: **Rhodia dotPad, A3**

  A huge A3 dotted notepad that I like to have sat on my desk at work. Great for writing organised lists of tasks on^[I use [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) notation.] and sketching out prototypes.

### Tech üíæ

- Phone: **iPhone 8**

  I decided not to upgrade to the iPhone X and instead went for the 8. I've been incredibly happy with it, especially now that I'm living the case-less lifestyle.

- In-Ear Headphones: **AirPods**

  Without a doubt the best Apple product I've ever owned. These headphones have completely changed the way that I consume content by being so incredibly simple. They're always with me and can be out of my pocket, in my ears, and connected to my phone in less than 5 seconds. It's sometimes hard to explain the appeal of these headphones to someone who hasn't used them. The audio-quality is great, the battery lasts _forever_, and they _just work_.

- Noise-Cancelling Headphones: **Bose QuietComfort 25**

  One of the best pairs of noise-cancelling headphones on the market, surpassed only by their most-recent update, the QC35.

- Laptop: **12" MacBook, 2015**

  I bought the 12" MacBook adorable^[CGP Grey, [2016](https://overcast.fm/+E7b4YzNfw/1:11:22).] as soon as it was released and have loved it ever since. It's not without its issues (it gets a bit warm sometimes, the keyboard isn't great, and its single USB-C port is tempermental at best), but overall it's a great machine that I'd recommend to anyone.

- Mechanical Keyboard: **WhiteFox Keyboard**

  My keyboard of choice at work. A fantastic mechanical keyboard that I purchased from MassDrop a few years ago after coveting it for quite a while. I use Cherry MX Brown switches with the True Fox layout.

- Mechanical Keyboard: **Ducky Shine 3, Year of the Snake**

  My first mechanical keyboard, which I bought primarily for gaming. This workhorse has survived many hours of PC gaming, as well as being the keyboard I use for most development work at home when my MacBook is docked. This also uses Cherry MX Browns, along with Tai Hao Sunshine keycaps.
