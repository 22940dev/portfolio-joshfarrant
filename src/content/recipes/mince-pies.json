      "step": "Add sugar and egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix gently until it just comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough at this point."

    {
      "step": "Gently firm the dough into a ball with your hands. You may need a little more flour. It should be like a dry pasta dough, but not so dry that it can't be rolled."
    },
    {
      "step": "Roll the dough out quite thinly, a few mm thick should do."
    },
    {
      "step": "Use a cutter to cut the dough into circles and place into your baking tin."

    {
      "step": "Spoon a teaspoon or so of mixture into each mince pie."
    },
    {
      "step": "Use a slightly smaller cutter to cut lids for the mince pies. Place a lid on each mince pie and gently crimp the edges to seal. Prick each lid with a fork to allow steam to escape."
    },
    {
      "step": "Bake the mince pies for 10-12 minutes, 15 minutes at the absolute most as they colour quickly. The mince pies should be a light golden colour, not pale or dark."
    },
    {
      "step": "Remove the mince pies from the tins and cool on a wire rack."
