## Races ðŸ‘Ÿ

I started running on May 29, 2017. That first 5 km run was hard work, despite only ~~running~~ jogging for about half it and walking the rest. I still enjoyed it though, so I went through the _Couch to 5K_ program and started running parkrun most weekends.

In April 2018 I ran my first half marathon. The first 15 km were fine, the remaining 6 km, however, were not fun. I need to spend a bit more time practising races of that length if I ever want to run another half marathon.
